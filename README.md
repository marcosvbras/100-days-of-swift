This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes: [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python), [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby), [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin). So, in this repository I learn something new about Swift every day during 100 days.
