## What is this?

**100 Days Of Swift** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Swift every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby)
-   [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin)
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [60 Days Of Shell Script](https://github.com/marcosvbras/60-days-of-shell-script)

## Why am I doing this? Why Swift?

Writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing efficient, clear, concise, scalable, and maintainable code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding.
